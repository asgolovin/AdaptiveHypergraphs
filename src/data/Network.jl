"""
    HyperNetwork

A higher-order network where every node can be in a particular state (SIS or SIR).

The topology of the network is represented by a hypergraph: a graph, where every hyperedge can connect multiple vertices, and not just two. 

Other than the hypergraph and the states, the struct keeps track of any statistics related to the system such as the number of infected nodes. 

Important assumptions / modifications to traditional hypergraphs:
 - Empty hyperedges or hyperedges with just one node can't exist. If a node is removed from a hyperedge of size two, the hyperedge is deleted.
 - The number of nodes stays constant. Even if a node is not connected to any hyperedeges, it is not deleted. 

Assumptions which are not yet quite enforced in the code, but are a TODO:
 - Parallel hyperedges (hyperedges with exactly the same set of nodes) can't exist
 - Degenerate hyperedges (hyperedges where the same node occures multiple times) can't exist
